# Lexiconizer
A refactor of my solution for the following puzzle. Given a text input:
- Count the number of occurrences of each word.
- Find each word's list of "neighbours". A neighbour word is any word of the same length, which differs by only one character.
- Write this information to file. The lexicon and neighbour-lists must be in alphabetical order.
- Built-in sorting methods are not allowed.
- The goal is to get the fastest possible execution time.
